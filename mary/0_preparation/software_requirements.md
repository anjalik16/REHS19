## Preparing for the Summer Institute: Software Requirements

While many of the hands-on activities will be run on Comet, some sessions require that customized software be installed on your laptop. Please perform the following software installations and file downloads before you arrive. Note: several of the preparation activities will provide information and guidance on how to install the required software components.

### Preparation: Setting up GitHub Account  <a name="github"></a>
Tutorial material and software will be available via a GitHub repository that anyone can clone (download). Make sure your laptop can run git. See the GitHub guide here:  [https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git](https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git). 

### Preparation: Anaconda for Jupyter Notebooks <a name="anaconda"></a>
Some sessions and tutorials will be using Jupyter Notebooks. To learn more, see Jupyter/IPython Notebook Quick Start Guide:
[https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

The Jupyter Notebook App can be installed using a scientific python distribution which also includes scientific python packages. The most common distribution is called Anaconda. To download:

### Plenary session: An Introduction to Singularity: Containers for Scientific and High-Performance Computing <a name="singularity"></a>

Participants who will be attending the Using Virtualization on Comet - Singularity Containers or Comet Virtual Cluster session on Monday afternoon and wish to build their own sample Singularity Containers should make the following preparations.

* Computers are required (tablets are not sufficient for this tutorial).

* [Download](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and install Oracle VirtualBox 5.2 and VirtualBox 5.2.16 Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack (**if needed**).

* [Download](https://forge.sdsc.edu/si2018-singularity.ova) and save the SDSC Summer Institute 2018 Oracle VirtualBox Singularity Appliance (**~1.5GB**).

### Plenary session: SeedMe2: Creating data centric websites for researchers and research projects <a name="seedme"></a>

All participants should take the following steps.

* [Download](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) and install Docker community edition for your operating system
    * Test if docker setup works on [linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-from-a-package) or [mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#explore-the-application) or [windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#explore-the-application)
+ [Download](https://dibbs.seedme.org/sites/dibbs.seedme.org/files/docker-images/seedme-workshop-2018-begin.tar.gz) begin docker image, this will be used to get started with the tutorial
+ [Download](https://dibbs.seedme.org/sites/dibbs.seedme.org/files/docker-images/seedme-workshop-2018-final.tar.gz) final docker image, this is a fully configured sandbox website 

### Parallel session: Machine Learning Overview (scheduled opposite Scientific Visualization with Visit) <a name="mach-learn"></a>

Participants who will be attending the Machine Learning Overview parallel session on Tuesday morning will need to install R (https://www.r-project.org/) and RStudio Desktop open source edition (https://www.rstudio.com/) on their laptops. Notes on using R on Comet can be found here:
[https://github.com/sdsc/sdsc-summer-institute-2018/blob/master/0_preparation/RStudio on Comet_07-18-2018.pdf](https://github.com/sdsc/sdsc-summer-institute-2018/blob/master/0_preparation/RStudio on Comet_07-18-2018.pdf)

A basic understanding of R will be very helpful and we recommend the following resources:

* https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf
* https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html


### Parallel session: Scientific visualization with Visit (scheduled opposite Machine Learning Overview) <a name="visit"></a>

Participants who will be attending the Scientific visualization with Visit session on Thursday morning should make the following preparations.

* Computer, mouse with scroll wheel are required (tablets are not sufficient for this tutorial).

* [Download](https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/executables) and install VisIt version 3.0.1 (**the latest version**). Please do not compile from source unless you are adventurous

* Test run VisIt application on your laptop to make sure it works

* Download sample data: [visit_data_files.tar.gz](https://wci.llnl.gov/content/assets/docs/simulation/computer-codes/visit/visit_data_files.tar.gz). Unzip to your desktop

* Download [Comet host profile for VisIt-3.0.x](http://users.sdsc.edu/~amit/comet/visit3.0.x-comet-host-profile.zip).  
    Unzip and copy this file as follows  
    Linux and Mac: ~/.visit/hosts/  
    Windows: C:/users/username/Documents/visit/hosts/   
    Restart VisIt
